    "\n",
    "There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x 3 cost matrix costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...\n",

    "## My Notes\n",
    "The bruteforce approach is to recursively try all the permutations and eliminate such permutation that does have two adjacent houses are painted in same color. A better approach is to try permutations that have adjacent houses painted in different color & pick the minimum cost from it. The recursive/memoized solution is easy to understand than the bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach uses the same costs array to store the minimum cost instead of auxilary space.\n",
