    "The bruteforce approach is to recursively try all the permutations and eliminate such permutation that does have two adjacent houses are painted in same color. A better approach is to try permutations that have adjacent houses painted in different color & pick the minimum cost from it. The recursive/memoized solution is easy to understand than the bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach uses the same costs array to store the minimum cost instead of auxilary space.\n",
